          <h2>Our <span className="accent">Story</span></h2>
          <p>
TEDxIntegralUniversity marks the inaugural TEDx event hosted at Integral University, Lucknow. As the university's first independently organized TEDx experience, it represents a milestone in fostering meaningful conversations, bold ideas, and collaborative innovation.
</p>
<p>
Bringing together students, researchers, entrepreneurs, educators, artists, and changemakers, TEDxIntegralUniversity creates a platform where diverse perspectives converge to inspire curiosity, encourage dialogue, and spark real-world impact. Guided by TED's mission of <strong>Ideas Worth Spreading</strong>, our event celebrates the belief that every individual carries an idea capable of creating positive change.
</p>
          <div className="about-highlight-box">
            <p>
             "Like pieces in a tessellation, every idea has its own shape—but together they create something far greater than any one perspective could achieve."
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Our <span className="accent">Theme</span></h2>
          <p>
<strong>TESSELLATION — From Individual Ideas to Collective Impact.</strong> Inspired by the mathematical concept of tessellation, where individual shapes fit seamlessly together to create a unified pattern, our theme reflects the strength found in diversity, collaboration, and shared purpose.
</p>
          <p>
Every speaker, attendee, volunteer, and partner contributes a unique perspective. Alone, each idea holds value; together, they form a larger vision capable of inspiring innovation and meaningful change. TESSELLATION is more than this year's theme—it is an invitation to discover how our individual experiences connect to build something extraordinary.
</p>

          <h2>Our <span className="accent">Vision</span></h2>
         <p>
Our vision is to cultivate a culture where curiosity fuels innovation, dialogue bridges disciplines, and ideas empower action. Through TEDxIntegralUniversity, we aspire to create an inclusive platform that connects students, professionals, researchers, creators, and leaders who believe in the transformative power of knowledge and conversation. As the first TEDx event at Integral University, we hope to establish a lasting tradition that inspires future generations to think critically, lead compassionately, and contribute confidently to society.
